# Incremental-calculation-of-shortest-path-in-dynamic-graphs
Shortest path queries on a changing graph. We will provide an initial graph that you may process. Once this is done, we will begin issuing a workload consisting of a series of sequential operation batches. Each operation is either a graph modification (insertion or removal) or a query about the shortest path between two nodes in the graph.
